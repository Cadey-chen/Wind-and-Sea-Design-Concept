# Wind-Sea-Design-Concept
  - Designs by Cadey Chen
  - Designed with Figma 
  
  - The shapes and patterns are inspired by Ancient Chinese and Japanese Art.
  - The colour palette is inspired by Impressionist artists such as Claude Monet and Edgar Degaz. It is overall soft, and gentle.
  - I used different shades of blues that tie closely with the concept of Wind and Sea, the theme of the website, as well as fluidity, an important concept in Daoism. 
  - The goal of the design was to create a visual imagery that closely resembles the concepts of Daoism, and at the same time would remind the user of traditional Chinese sceneries to elevate their experience interacting with the website.
